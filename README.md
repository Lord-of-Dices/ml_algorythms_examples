# ML Algorithms Examples

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented for some projects during MA studies. It serves as a reference for educational purposes and demonstrates some ML techincs:

- **Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM)**: Various approaches to categorize data into binary or multi-class labels.
- **Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)**: Examples of unsupervised learning to group similar data points together.
- **Decision Trees, Random Forests, Regression algorythms**: Implementations of these powerful algorithms for classification and prediction tasks.

Each file contains the code and comments which explaining the purpose and outcome of the respective model.
